We are going to cover everything -- improving your skill to various levels, every archer trick/move you can do in this game and much more. Archer combat isn't as complex as knight combat and some players consider archer combat much easier to learn. If you want to get better this guide will certainly help you. For a tutorial on playing as knight see: Knight Guide. For a tutorial on playing as builder see: Builder Guide. You can contact us on KAG Discord (bunnie#8553, unit#8073 (Turtlebutt)). Special thanks to deynarde for setting up the github repository for this. "],["archer-i-basics.html", "Chapter 1 Archer I: Basics 1.1 The archer class 1.2 Mechanics 1.3 Items 1.4 Learning &amp; playing as a beginner", " Chapter 1 Archer I: Basics 1.1 The archer class There are three classes in KAG: the archer, the builder and the knight. While the archer isn't as strong as the knight class, it's a very fun fun class to play in TDM and is viable support in CTF if played well. Good archers can play aggressively while getting as many kills as knights. A good team in Capture The Flag (CTF) or Take The Halls (TTH) should have at least 2-3 archers (if your team isn't lacking knights, of course). As an archer in CTF and TTH, your role is to support your team by being an annoyance to enemy knights or using special arrows, but before we get to that part, let's talk about the combat mechanics first. 1.2 Mechanics As an archer, you have a bow with a limited amount of arrows and a grappling hook which gives archers superior mobility. 1.2.1 Full shot Charging a bow to do what is known as a 'full shot' takes a full second (30 ticks). The cursor isn't exactly accurate -- you can do a fullshot on 90% of cursor charge (final yellow dot before full charge). A fullshot deals 1 heart of damage and stuns the enemy for a short while if done in a close distance (if it's a shielding knight, it will stun them but not damage them). Fullshots don't stun the enemy if they're 6 or more blocks away. Fullshots are obviously also used at longer distances that halfshots wouldn't reach. You can use fullshots to, for example, stun gliding knights to make them fall into a pit. 1.2.2 Half shot Half shot requires charging for slightly more than half of the cursor -- the final red dot, as seen in the gif below. Quick halfshots are a significant amount of any good archer's kills, especially if fighting against other enemy archers at a mid range distance. They don't stun on close distance like full shots, have a lower velocity and travel less distance, but they do the same amount of damage -- 1 heart. You should use them at mid-range fights when supporting your knights as well -- they're the most useful shots most of the time. Some examples of using halfshots below: There are also certain situations where a halfshot can hit someone when a fullshot wouldn't -- due to smaller velocity of a half hot, they can start falling down sooner than fullshots and do arc shots. In some situations if you shoot a half shot and it hits the enemy that was far away, it can to lose some velocity along the way and do 0.5 heart of damage instead, like in the gif below. This is because damage of arrows is dependent on their velocity when they hit somebody. This usually happens whenever you halfshot an archer camping with significant height advantage (arrows have the lowest velocity when they reach the highest point they can get to before starting to fall down and gain velocity again). This can happen to full shots too. 1.2.3 Quarter shot A quarter shot is the quickest shot. You need to charge it for only a short while (1/3 of a second) -- you can release when the cursor reaches the first red dot. It does 0.5 heart of damage. Keep in mind that you can't just spam them by rapidly clicking left click -- your bow won't shoot anything until the cursor reaches the first red dot. If the arrow has time to gain velocity and you have a bit of height advantage, it can also do 1 heart of damage. It's a good tactic to spam quarter shots from your tower in CTF when there are lots of enemies below. In the gif below, I kill the blue archer with quarter shots that gain enough velocity to do 1 heart of damage each. Quartershots can be used to finish low-health enemies as well. 1.2.4 Triple shot Triple shot is the strongest attack. Requires charging for 2 seconds, shoots 3 arrows on release. The top and bottom arrows decay after a second or so, while the middle one has the velocity of a full charged shot and does not decay. If you triple shot a shielding knight from close distance, the middle arrow will stun them and the other arrows will do a heart of damage each, dealing a total of 2 hearts of damage, as well as do a slight knockback. It can kill full-health archers or builders instantly if all the arrows hit (or just 2 for enemy archers). Triple shots can often be charged while behind cover (for example team doors), and then only be shot after peeking out with a full or almost full charge. Triple shot accelerates enemy kegs: 1.2.5 Mixing different shots Good archers are able to freely use different shots depending on the situation and distance between you and the enemy. Use fullshots for close-range stuns, halfshots for midrange, and fullshots again for long range. Try to be fast in order to surprise your enemy. Use the terrain to your advantage -- you have lots of time to charge your bow when behind cover. 1.2.6 Aiming into the direction you move You should almost always aim in the direction you're moving to -- all classes in KAG move faster when moving towards the way they're looking at (the cursor's direction, either left or right). When retreating, you shouldn't move backwards while shooting the other direction -- this is one of the most common mistakes for new archer players. Don't do this -- just look away from the enemy while escaping, and then look back at them only when your bow is already charged. 1.2.7 Climbing trees You're able to climb trees as an archer (knights or builders can't do that). To do that, you must hold W when in front of a tree. When you're on a tree, you don't have to hold any keys, but pressing S will make you fall off the tree until you start holding W again. 1.2.8 Fletching arrows from wood Aiming at a log, a stack of wood or at a tree and clicking right mouse button will fletch a single arrow. Hold the button to fletch more arrows. Keep in mind that you have to aim exactly at the wooden thing you're fletching arrows from, or else you will just release your grappling hook. 1.2.9 Grappling, mobility Mobility is one of the most important aspects of playing against other players -- using the grappling hook is a must. The grappling hook gives archer the most mobility out of all three classes, making archer the most mobile class in combat situations. It can give you speed that can be used in many situations, like stealing the flag, someones dropped items, climbing a tower and harassing the enemy builder, or just going through the map fast. The mobility you have thanks to the grappling hook is a major reason why archer is the most fun class to play for majority of its main players. As you can see in the gif above, you should move back slightly every time after throwing your grappling hook on ground. This will cause the grapple to throw you further when you'll start moving forward. Jumping at the right time also gives you additional velocity. All of this is done instinctively by experienced archers -- just keep practicing grappling until it feels natural to you. 1.2.9.1 Grappling through trees While throwing yourself through trees with the grappling hook, you shouldn't hold W in order to not slow yourself down by climbing the trees. First flick attempt in the gif below is done with holding W during the flick, second attempt -- without. You can use trees to get a lot of velocity as well. One thing you can do is do a long jump: jump off a tree (as far away from it as possible, but still in grapple range), grapple the top while falling then after hitting the ground jump to get additional velocity (press W) and throw yourself. Make sure that the grappling hook hits the tree right before you fall on the ground and jump. You should practice this in solo sandbox on trees. 1.2.9.2 Grappling to climb enemy wall The grappling hook relies on momentum, meaning the more momentum you have, the faster you will go forward, this is why spamming your grappling hook to climb the enemy wall will be more of a disadvantage than advantage. Proper way to climb is shown below. As you can see, we grapple as far as possible while falling down. Right after the grappling hook hits the wall, we do a walljump to get additional velocity and go upwards faster. Another gif showing climbing with grappling hook: 1.2.9.3 Grappling to dodge danger You can often dodge enemy bombs, arrows, or avoid enemies themselves by using your grappling hook. 1.2.9.4 You can't grapple while charging arrows However, you should keep in mind that you can't throw your grappling hook while charging your bow. You can only first grapple, and then start charging an arrow, but you can't re-grapple while charging. 1.2.10 Stomping You can stomp enemies by falling on top of them, which stuns them and does damage depending on your velocity (1 heart or 2 hearts). The grappling hook helps you to gain velocity you wouldn't have by normally jumping, this gets nullified at bigger fall distances as you will not have time to grapple down at the ground to get that extra momentum, because the grapple falls slower than yourself. You can also grapple to a wall/tower/tree while stomping someone so you don't completely touch the ground and you are safe from other enemy knights, this can also give you momentum to immediately get back up. You can't stomp a knight that is shielding up, regardless of velocity. Stomping is a good way to gain extra damage in TDM aswell, as the combat is much more compact than in CTF. There will be more about stomping in the next chapter. 1.3 Items Archer has three special arrow types - water arrow, fire arrow and bomb arrow. Each arrow has a different role. You can swap arrows by holding F and selecting them in the menu, but the quickest way is just to tap F, which will swap to the next arrow. This also works when you're in the middle of charging a shot. 1.3.1 Water arrows Water arrows can extinguish fires (both on teammates or enemies) or stun enemies (they don't stun teammates) for a while to gain extra time or make enemies defenseless against your teammates. As you can see in the gif above, you can extinguish a fire arrow before the fire even starts spreading (first water arrow I use). Stunning enemies: A good tactic when using water is to stun enemies and then quickly halfshot or fullshot them before they get unstunned and can react. Can also use a fire or a bomb arrow instead of a normal halfshot. Water arrows can also be combined with stomps. Using water arrows on knights that hold a bomb in their hand will make them unable to throw the bomb while stunned -- it will explode in their hand and deal 3 hearts of damage. Water arrows' stun can go through blocks -- up to 2 layers of blocks, although it's much more common to stun through one layer of blocks, like in the gif above. You can stun enemies through walls to make them fall from ladders and die to fall damage. Keep in mind that the stun lasts less (half of original duration) if the enemy had their shield up and even less if they had a sponge in inventory (1/3 of original duration). Shield up: Sponge: Both (even shorter stun): 1.3.2 Fire arrows Fire arrows can burn wooden structures or enemy players to make them run towards their cursors' direction. This means that the shot will deal them 1 heart of damage, and the fire will deal them 0.25 hearts of damage each second for 4 seconds (so up to 2 hearts). Keep in mind: A close fullshot of a fire arrow doesn't stun the enemy like a normal arrow would. Whenever somebody is on fire, their character always moves forward in the direction they're looking (have their cursor). Using a fire arrow on an enemy archer will often kill them (as long as they don't have water or any way to heal themselves). Fire arrows shot at enemy kegs (or enemy players holding kegs) will make them catch fire which will ignite them. Lit kegs can be extinguished with a water bucket only, so be careful if your team has kegs stored up in a spot accessible for enemy archers in CTF. This also happens if wooden background, wooden blocks, or just grass or bushes next to the keg start burning. In the gif below, I put a keg on a spot where my teammate shot a fire arrow. The fire on the bush/grass causes it to get lit, so I take it and kill an enemy knight with it. If you shoot a fire arrow at an enemy standing in wooden doors, both the enemy will catch on fire as well as the doors. 1.3.3 Bomb arrows Bomb arrows can do significant damage on impact, 3 hearts of damage at most. They instantly kill enemy builders and archers. They're also very good to be used against enemy structures as they will destroy 3 blocks facing opposite of the bomb arrows tip, they also do have some area of damage around the impact, which can break backwalls, which makes them excellent at collapsing enemy towers and opening enemy flagrooms, although they obviously don't hit backwalls themselves. Keep in mind: A close fullshot of a bomb arrow doesn't stun the enemy like a normal arrow would. First, some gifs demonstrating using bomb arrows against enemy archers in TDM: Bomb arrows do the same amount of damage regardless of whether they were shot as a quartershot, halfshot or a fullshot. If bomb arrows are shot as a triple shot, only the middle one will be a bomb arrow. This applies to water and fire arrows as well. After using bomb arrows on knights, you can try finishing them with a fullshot or a halfshot to take the last heart. The explosion from bomb arrows is strong enough to stop enemy knights from being able to wallclimb. Using bomb arrows to collapse structures on enemies: Using bomb arrows to damage enemy structures in CTF: One bomb arrow destroys a catapult, and two bomb arrows destroy a ballista, so whenever you see enemy siege vehicles, you should bomb arrow them -- this will significantly help your team. If you're unsure if your bomb arrow will hit (especially if you have to do an arc shot), you can first shoot normal arrows at the enemy vehicle, and once you know where to shoot so that it hits, you can shoot bomb arrows. Bomb arrows are also very good for damaging spike traps -- they destroy a lot of spikes in one shot. Trap bridges are weak against bomb arrows as well. As you can see, platforms are a bit more resistant to bomb arrows than other blocks. However, if you shoot a bomb arrow at a stone wall, with platforms behind that wall, they also get slightly damaged: You destroy much more enemy doors if there's an enemy standing in them. For example, if someone is holding 3 layers of doors open like in the gif below, shooting a bomb arrow at them would destroy all 3 layers of doors plus one more layer behind. 1.3.4 Boulder Aside from arrows, a good archer item is the boulder. Boulders can be used very effectively as archer in TDM, not so much in CTF though (due to them costing stone in the builder shop, rather than coins). You can instakill anyone if you manage to hit them with enough momentum, although this is very risky as you will need to get close with a lot of velocity. This is hard to do consistently due to maps not being smooth and boulders not very reliable, plus the fact that boulders also make you move slower. Many people don't know that in TDM, bought boulders will never do damage to the team of the player who bought it. This causes many people to use the boulder and cripple themselves. This mechanic works like that only in TDM though, boulders in CTF will damage your team if the last person holding it was an enemy. Boulders can do 0.5, 1.5 and full health of damage, depending on the boulder's velocity. They sometimes bounce twice on an enemy head, which will add at least half a heart of damage. Below are some gifs demonstrating how boulders can be used in TDM. Notice that we're using the grappling hook to gain additional velocity most of the time. 1.3.5 Shooting mines You can shoot enemy mines to make them explode. 1.3.6 Shooting grain If you shoot at the block grain is growing on, you will be able to pick up the grain (It's a food item, similar to a burger -- use it whenever on low health) 1.4 Learning &amp; playing as a beginner What you should focus on learning as a beginner is the various shots, mobility and aim. You should charge triple, full and half shots as fast as possible - in some cases, being faster than your opponent is what will decide the outcome of an archer duel. You should also be able to move freely around the map with your grappling hook, as well as during combat. Being able to aim (while doing various shots) is also what you should focus on at this level. Some more things to keep in mind are: Breaking your rhythm when fighting other archers is an important thing to do, most of the time it lets you get in at least 1 extra shot. By this we mean not moving too predictably (mind games). Changing your targets at the last second works too, or just changing if you know you can't hit your original target. It's easy to setup kills for your teammates as an archer, like using fullshots to stun and stall enemy movement. Don't get too close, because sometimes teammates ignore the free kill/assist, and you are alone in a close combat situation with an enemy knight for an example. Also basic things like constantly shooting enemies with halfshots/fullshots from a distance to keep pressure on them, are very helpful for your team. Attacking the most important targets like builders instead of knights or archers, evaluate the situation and go for the most important enemy, even if it means you die. "],["archer-ii-getting-better.html", "Chapter 2 Archer II: Getting better 2.1 Max zoom vs middle zoom, fixed camera vs unfixed 2.2 Some more tricks 2.3 CTF-specific stuff", " Chapter 2 Archer II: Getting better 2.1 Max zoom vs middle zoom, fixed camera vs unfixed There are 3 main types of zoom in kag -- max zoom in, middle zoom and max zoom out. The first one is almost always bad and you shouldn't use it. Most archers decide to mostly use middle zoom in mid and close-range and then swap to max zoom out in long-range fights. However, to some aiming may be confusing if they swap the zooms often, so some stick to max zoom out, even on mid-range and close-range fights. Both have their pros and cons and it's up to each individual to decide what they prefer. It's also dependent on what camera they decide to use. You can also use the zoom levels in-between middle and max zoom out -- to use one of them, hold CTRL while scrolling in or out. There are 2 kinds of cameras in KAG - unfixed camera and fixed (this can be changed in settings). With fixed camera, your character is always in the center of the screen; with unfixed camera, the camera follows your mouse on middle zoom. Unfixed camera allows you to theoretically shoot on long range distances with middle zoom, but sometimes you won't notice what happens closer to your character and you may have more troubles with aiming using unfixed camera. Again, it's up to you to choose which one you feel more comfortable with; don't be afraid to experiment. 2.2 Some more tricks 2.2.1 Momentum jump Momentum jumps are when you use your grapple to gain high velocity and combining it with shooting at the enemy. One way to easily get momentum for your grapple by throwing it as far as you can while having a single block stop you from going forward, then jump. The main point of this is to be able to charge your bow before jumping -- you can't use your grappling hook while charging your bow, as mentioned in the first chapter, so you need to grapple first, then start charging right after, then jump and release the arrow at the right time. It's mostly used to surprise enemies. A specific momentum jump is when you have 2 blocks blocking you from going forward. In this case, you can shoot an arrow on the top block and then hold W to climb the arrow and get over the obstacle. You can do a momentum jump without a stopping block too -- throw your grappling hook as far as possible, start holding left mouse button right after, move back until the grappling hook touches the ground, then pull yourself and jump. Without a stopping block you don't have as much time to charge your bow, but you still can just quartershot someone, or even halfshot in some cases. Momentum jumps are also often combined with stomping. A bit more complex momentum jump -- first we shoot a quartershot water arrow to stun the archer with a boulder after momentum jumping, then we keep using our grapple to gain velocity again and stomp the other camping archer. Momentum jumps are also used when damaging enemies with boulders, as you could see in some of the gifs in the earlier chapter in the Boulders section. 2.2.2 Crouching Crouching is a largely forgotten, although very useful mechanic in KAG. Basically, when you hold down S, as long as you don't move with your control keys (W/A/S/D) enemies can go through you -- and in certain cases, you can go through enemies. Keep in mind, there is only a seperate animation for crouching while being idle, but no seperate animations for shooting while crouching. For example, if someone is trying to stomp or shieldbash you, you can crouch to avoid being hit, and then shoot them: This is mostly done against builders and archers. Knights can sometimes combine stomping with slashing on lesser distances, which crouching won't counter. However, if the distance is big enough like in the gifs above, they may try to stomp with their shield down (to not die from the fall damage caused by additional velocity from slashing), in which case this is still viable. 2.2.3 Crouching + grappling (crouch sliding) Another cool mechanic is that you can grapple the ground while crouching, allowing you to go through enemies as long as you stay on the ground and don't use control keys (W/A/D), just using your grapple's momentum. Basically, do a momentum jump, but make sure you stay on the ground and don't hold A or D while moving through the enemy with S pressed down. This is often done right after stunning the enemy with a fullshot. After doing that, you can shoot enemies in their back. In the gifs below, first we flick ourselves with our grappling hook, then start holding S and letting go of other keys after hitting the ground while charging another shot at the same time. 2.2.4 Cancelling your current shot As mentioned earlier, you can't use your grappling hook when charging an arrow. Clicking the right mouse button will cancel the current shot you're charging (holding will prevent you from charging at all). This lets you time your shots better. 2.2.5 Close archer combat - fullshot + halfshot on another archer In close archer combat, whenever you're fighting against another archer, you can try to stun them with a full shot -- they can't move or shoot during the stun period and that allows you to get the half shot in just as they get unstunned. Very efficient for taking out archers who decide to come close to you. 2.2.6 Using quartershots Spamming quartershots in close combat is not very effective since they have small velocity and do only half a heart of damage. As mentioned in the previous chapter, best way to use them is by having significant height advantage over the enemy and then spamming quartershots, they will do 1 damage if they have time to gain enough velocity. In the gif below, we deal 3 hearts of damage to the enemy with just quartershot spam and then finish them with a fullshot. Another good way is when you're escaping from an enemy knight that is constantly trying to attack. You can shoot quartershots slightly upwards so they hit the enemy right as they get close close. Quartershots, as mentioned in the previous chapter, are also quite good for finishing off people with only half a heart. 2.2.7 Triple shot on ceiling-camping archer In situations like in the gifs below, you're able to charge a triple shot, fall down slightly, release it to kill the archer then quickly grapple right back to not fall. 2.2.8 Baiting knights + triple shot Letting the enemy get close to you right before finishing charging a triple shot is a good way to surprise them and deal damage. 2.2.9 Mid range triple shot Even on mid range, if you shoot a triple shot at the right direction and angle, you can have 2 out of 3 arrows hit the enemy -- so if you hit an archer, they'll die. 2.2.10 Fullshot stun + quartershot combo on knights You can stun a shielding knight with a fullshot and then quickly quartershot them when they're still stunned to guarantee a half a heart hit. Fullshotting a non-shielding knight from close distance will let you shoot them with a quartershot while they're still stunned. 2.2.11 Shooting over enemy knight shield Enemy archers will sometimes try to hide behind knights' shields. You can try to shoot slightly above the knight to hit the enemy archer. 2.2.12 Stomping aggressively If you're quick and fast enough, you can often stomp knights and archers when they don't expect it by using your grappling hook to gain additional velocity. Very good archers are able to stomp enemies (even charging knights) freely without getting hurt. There are also some arrow + stomp combinations. You shoot a fullshot to stun a knight first, and then stomp them (due to height advantage or using your grappling hook for additional velocity, or both). Stomping and shooting a fullshot or a halfshot at enemy archers at the same time will kill them most of the time (1 heart from stomp, 1 heart from fullshot/halfshot, plus they're obviously not able to shield it). 2 Heart stomps are difficult to pull off, but are very rewarding if you manage to do them. You need to be able to use your grappling hook to get lots of velocity and/or significant height advantage. You should either do this whenever the enemy is busy focusing on a teammate or inbetween their slashes, this is almost not worth doing if you are lagging since you won't be able to time the stomp perfectly. Another good trick is combining a triple shot (previously charged somewhere where you have height advantage) with a stomp. Keep in mind that knights can avoid getting stomped by crouching -- if some knight is not moving with their shield up, it's likely that he's trying to bait you while crouching. However, shooting a fullshot will stun them, and since you're unable to crouch while stunned, you will be able to damage them with a stomp. It works like in the gif below. However, you can also decide not to stomp -- just wait to get inside them first, and then shoot an arrow. You will do a heart of damage again. Remember that you can't stomp shielding knights without stunning them with an arrow first -- just throwing yourself at them won't do anything and will likely get you killed. 2.2.13 Catching and throwing back enemy bombs If enemy knights throw a bomb at you, you can try catching it and throwing it back if there's enough time for the bomb to not kill you. Although it's a bit tricker to do, you can also catch water bombs before they hit you and throw them back. 2.2.14 Catching kegs With fast enough reflexes you can catch kegs thrown at you. 2.2.15 Baiting with a grapple If you're cornered by or just close to a knight, you can throw grapple but not actually use it to make the knight think you're going to grapple and try to go through them or jump at them. This will often cause them to start charging an attack or jab, allowing you to quickly shoot them. It sometimes works against archers as well -- they shoot an arrow in where you would be if you have had grappled. You can also grapple over the heads of enemy knights. They're likely to start charging a slash or try to jab when you do that, again giving you enough time to hit them with a halfshot 2.2.16 Shooting food to your teammates Rarely useful, but a fun trick if you manage to do it -- you can shoot an arrow right after throwing a burger (or a dead fish, or any other food item) to make the burger gain high velocity. 2.2.17 Shooting off and lighting kegs from enemy knights' backs If you shoot at the keg of an enemy (and not at the enemy itself), regardless of whether it's lit or not, they drop the keg. After picking up the keg, you can also use your grappling hook to get enough velocity and instantly explode the keg, killing enemies in the process. If there's a knight with a keg on their back coming to you, you can try to crouch slide through him and shoot an arrow on the keg and then pick it up. If the enemy has their shield up, sometimes (although not always -- this seems to be somewhat random, regardless of distance or angle) shooting at the shield will make the keg fall. However, the most reliable way is to just shoot at the head whenever the enemy is shielding. It works the same with lighting enemy kegs by fire arrows -- if the enemy is shielding, it may or may not prevent the keg from being lit (although with fire it's a bit more likely to light the keg). Again, best way is to just aim at the head, or at the keg itself. Keep in mind that bomb arrows don't make kegs drop off enemies' backs, they just damage the keg. 2.3 CTF-specific stuff While most of what was mentioned earlier applies to all gamemodes, there's some CTF-specific stuff that you should also know. 2.3.1 Damaging siege (without special arrows) Shooting catapults or ballistas when they still have wheels attached makes them move. In some cases you can make a catapult or a ballista fall over, damaging it greatly. This however happens very rarely due to builders detaching wheels from vehicles right after unpacking them. Gif demonstrating movement of vehicles with wheels while shot at below. If you manage to get right next to an enemy catapult, you can shoot it with a triple shot at the correct angle to move it, even if it doesn't have wheels attached: Although if you get to an enemy ballista, you should probably just swap class to knight or builder: 2.3.2 Getting mats from the enemy team Although this is fairly obvious, many archers just ignore materials laying around on the ground. If you see many materials laying around (especially on enemy territory, or after killing an enemy builder), you should pick them up and deliver to a close team builder or just to a safe spot. Generally, the most important materials are gold and stone, with wood not being as important. 2.3.3 Stealing the flag If the enemy flag has sparse defences, you could sneak to the enemy flagroom with a couple bomb arrows (usually 3 or 4) and steal the flag. Another thing worth knowing when trying to steal enemy flag is that you can't actually instantly kill yourself with a bomb arrow if you're on full health -- even if you shoot it right next to you, it will do no more than 1.5 hearts of damage to you. 2.3.4 Doors have weird hitbox Doors have slightly larger hitbox than normal blocks (or just are weird), which makes them a &quot;magnet&quot; to arrows sometimes. Shooting in a hole between doors is much harder and requires more precision than if you were shooting in a hole between normal blocks (stone blocks). 2.3.5 Grappling platforms You can make a wooden block ledge (as a builder obviously) on the top of your tower with platforms facing downwards like on the gif below. Grappling platforms like that lets you gain high velocity which can be used to reaching the enemy base. Make sure to not jump while doing this (or move in any direction) -- use your mouse (grapple) only. Jumping or moving for some reason makes you lose velocity in this situation. Start moving only after jumping off the platform. 2.3.6 Avoiding fall damage by landing on trees Self-explanatory. Hold W while falling on a tree. A bit easier to do if you're moving slightly to the side. 2.3.7 Lighting keg as knight then swapping to archer This is often combined with the grappling platforms trick above. The idea is to light a keg while you're a knight, then quickly swap to archer on an archer shop and pick the keg back up. Since you're able to grapple as an archer, you can use the keg much more effectively than if you were a knight. Another thing you could do is ask a knight to light the keg for you and then drop it -- this doesn't require an archer shop. "],["archer-iii-expert.html", "Chapter 3 Archer III: Expert 3.1 Becoming the best", " Chapter 3 Archer III: Expert 3.1 Becoming the best There's not much to top tier archer playing other than perfecting your timing, aim and baiting the enemy using your movement. If you see an archer that is better than you, you should observe him and ask yourself what he's doing differently/better and focus on doing these things yourself. 3.1.1 Arc shots Arc shots are most likely the hardest thing to master in archer combat -- that is shooting an arrow (a halfshot or a fullshot) upwards with the goal to have it hit places where you wouldn't usually be able to shoot. You're able to use it on pretty much all maps where people can hide behind obstacles. There's not much to explain here -- you just need to shoot arrows at the proper angle. This is hard to master due to how arrows act -- they're pretty much just not affected by gravity for a short while after being shot, and then start falling down. The best way to train arc shots is just constant practice. You can do that both on online servers or practice yourself in Solo sandbox by building yourself a training course. Mastering this and always knowing where your arrows will land would make you one of the best archers in the game, but this requires lots of experience -- that is knowing where to put your cursor for halfshots and fullshots depending on the distance between you and the enemy. Some more examples of arc shots: Fullshot arc: Bomb arrow fullshot arc: Halfshot arc spam -- as you can see, it's hard for an archer to move around when there's lots of arrows flying around, so eventually they get hit by one of them: A single halfshot arc at game start: Two halfshot arcs, with each one hitting a different player: 3.1.2 Arc shot combos You can make a combo of arc shot + normal shot: shoot an arrow up, so that it arcs and hits the enemy on the head. Charge another arrow from the side and try to sync both of the arrows so that even if the enemy tries shielding, at least one of them hits. I do that twice in the gif below -- first when fighting against the red-haired knight, and again when fighting against the burger knight (with the 2nd arrow stunning the knight, which lets the arc arrow do damage) Another example with bomb arrows: Even if you miss one of the arrows, you're still more likely to hit the enemy if they move. You can also use arc shots to make campy archers move away from their spot, allowing you to hit them with a normal shot.
