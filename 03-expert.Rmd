## Becoming the best

There's not much to top tier archer playing other than perfecting your timing, aim and baiting the enemy using your movement. If you see an archer that is better than you, you should observe him and ask yourself what he's doing differently/better and focus on doing these things yourself.

### Arc shots

Arc shots are most likely the hardest thing to master in archer combat -- that is shooting an arrow upwards with the goal to have it hit places where you wouldn't usually be able to shoot. You're able to use it on pretty much all maps where people can hide behind obstacles.

In combat, if a knight keeps camping his shield and not moving, and you're too scared to go close to him, you can make a combo of arc shot + normal shot: shoot an arrow up, so it arcs and hits him on the head, if he shields up, you can start charging another shot and shoot him from the side, making him have to decide to either shield up or sideways.

It works if you're being chased by a knight as well, as in gif below.

You can use arc shots to make campy archers move away from their spot, allowing you to hit them with a normal shot.

Mastering this and always knowing where your arrows will land would make you one of the best archers in the game.

You can practice it on solo modes or empty servers as well by shooting objects that don't move - trees, specific blocks, etc.
