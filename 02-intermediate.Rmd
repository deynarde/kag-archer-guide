## Max zoom vs middle zoom, fixed camera vs unfixed

There are 3 types of zoom in kag - max zoom in, middle zoom and max zoom out. The first one is almost always bad and you shouldn't use it. Most archers decide to mostly use middle zoom in mid and close-range and then swap to max zoom out in long-range fights. However, to some aiming may be confusing if they swap the zooms often, so some stick to max zoom out, even on mid-range and close-range fights. Both have their pros and cons and it's up to each individual to decide what they prefer. It's also dependent on what camera they decide to use.

There are 2 kinds of cameras in KAG - unfixed camera and fixed (this can be changed in settings). With fixed camera, your character is always in the center of the screen; with unfixed camera, the camera follows your mouse on middle zoom. Unfixed camera allows you to theoretically shoot on long range distances with middle zoom, but sometimes you won't notice what happens closer to your character and you may have more troubles with aiming using unfixed camera. Again, it's up to you to choose which one you feel more comfortable with; don't be afraid to experiment.

## Some more tricks

### Crouching

Crouching is a largely forgotten, although very useful mechanic in KAG. Basically, when you hold down S, as long as you don't move with your control keys (W/A/S/D) enemies can go through you - and in certain cases, you can go through enemies.

Keep in mind, there is only a seperate animation for crouching while being idle, but no seperate animations for shooting while crouching.

For example, if someone is trying to stomp you, you can crouch to avoid being hit, and then shoot them:

[1]

Another cool mechanic is that you can grapple the ground while crouching, allowing you to go through enemies as long as you stay on the ground and don't use control keys (WASD), just using your grapple's momentum:

[2]

If a knight is trying to shieldbash you and quickly shield slides in your direction, you can also wait until he walks into you and then shoot him.

[3]

### Momentum jump

You can easily get momentum for your grapple by throwing it as far as you can and having a block stop you from going to it, then jump.

[4]

If the block stopping you is 2 blocks high, you can shoot an arrow on the higher block so you climb the arrow and then jump over

[5]

Since you can't grapple while charging your bow, as mentioned earlier, you can use this to your advantage -- grapple and charge your bow, and then make your jump and shoot an arrow.

[6]

### Grappling platforms

You can make a wooden block ledge on the top of your tower with platforms facing downwards like on the gif below. Grappling platforms like that lets you gain high velocity which can be used to reaching the enemy base.

[7]

Make sure to not jump while doing this (or move in any direction) -- use your mouse (grapple) only. Jumping or moving for some reason makes you lose velocity in this situation. Start moving only after you're jumping off the platform.

### Close archer combat

In close archer combat, you should always use half shots and sometimes quarter shots. However, in certain cases charging a full shot is also worth it -- you can to stun the enemy and then shoot them with a half shot, they can't move or shoot during the stun period and that allows you to get the half shot in just as they get unstunned. Very efficient for taking out archers who decide to come close to you.

[8]

Spamming quartershots in close combat is not very effective since your shots have small velocity and do half a heart of damage. They can be good for making a barrier if the enemy will die trying to pass it. As mentioned earlier, best way to use them is by being above the enemy, and then spamming quartershots, they will do 1 damage if they have time to gain enough velocity.

[9]

Quartershots, however, are quite good for finishing off people with only half a heart.

[10]

### Fullshot + quartershot combo on shielding knight

You can stun a shielding knight with a fullshot and then quartershot him to guarantee a 0.5 heart hit.

[11]

### Fullshot + grappling someone into a pit

If you're fighting a knight near a pit, you could stun him with a fullshot then use your grappling hook to move him to the pit, as shown in the gif below.

[12]

### Stomping aggressively

There are a lot of stomp + arrow combinations. Basically, if you know that you will stun someone by a stomp, it's good to charge an arrow -- sometimes a quartershot, a halfshot, and in some cases even a fullshot.

[13]

[14]

Very good archers are able to stomp enemies (even charging knights) freely without getting hurt.

[15]

2 Heart stomps are difficult to do in close situations, but are very rewarding if you manage to do them.

You should either do this whenever the enemy is busy focusing on a teammate or inbetween their slashes, this is almost not worth doing if you are lagging since you won't be able to time the stomp perfectly.

Another good trick is stomping someone and then shooting a triple shot.

[15.5]

Keep in mind that people can avoid getting stomped by crouching -- if some knight is not moving while you're on a tree, it's likely that he's trying to bait you while crouching.

[16]

Remember to keep in mind you can't stomp shielding knights at all.

### Throwing back enemy bombs

If enemy knights threw a bomb at you and you have enough time, you can try throwing it back:

[17]

### Catching kegs

With fast enough reflexes you can catch kegs thrown at you.

[18]

### Baiting with a grapple

If you're cornered by a knight, you can throw grapple (but not actually use it) to make the knight think you're going to grapple and try to go through them. This allows you to wait for a better opportunity to avoid them.

[19]

It sometimes works against archers -- they shoot an arrow in where you would be if you have had grappled.

[20]

### Shooting food to your teammates

Rarely useful, but a fun trick if you manage to do it -- you can shoot an arrow right after throwing a burger (or a dead fish) to make the burger gain high velocity.

[21]

### Shooting off and lighting kegs from enemy knights' backs

If you shoot at the keg of an enemy, they drop the keg.

[22]

If there's a knight with a keg on their back coming to you, you can try to crouch+grapple through him and shoot an arrow on the keg and then pick it up.

[23]

Keep in mind, in some cases you don't need to shoot exactly at the keg to make it drop.

If the enemy has his shield up, and you're close enough (less than around 10 blocks), just shooting at the shield will make the keg fall.

[24]

If the enemy is a bit far away, shooting at the shield won't do anything to the keg.

[25]

It works the same with lighting enemy kegs by fire arrows - if he's close to you, shooting a fire arrow just at the shield will light the keg, but if he's a bit more far away, it won't.

[26]

[27]

Keep in mind that bomb arrows don't make kegs drop off enemies' backs, they just damage the keg.

### Shooting mines

You can shoot enemy mines to make them explode.

[28]

### Shooting grain

If you shoot at the block below grain, you will be able to pick up the grain and use it to heal yourself.

[29]

### Water arrow + fire arrow combo

Slightly cheesy, but if you've got a water arrow and a fire arrow, you can stun someone with water, then do a fire halfshot.
